# Welcome to the Seki 8600 website!

Thank you for your interest in collaborating with us! This websie is all about the Go club in Diksmuide. We would like you to contribute and help us improve and expand it.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project on your local machine, you'll need to clone the repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:fred-lec/seki8600.git
```

This command will clone the repository and also ensure that all necessary submodules are included in the project.

### Requirements

Before you start working with the project, make sure you have Hugo installed on your system. Hugo is a fast and modern static site generator that we use for the project.

To install Hugo (use the extended version), follow the instructions on the official Hugo documentation: (v.0.147 or newer is required.)

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)

Once Hugo is installed, you can build and preview the site locally by running the following command:

```bash
hugo server
```

This will start a local development server and you can see your changes at `http://localhost:1313`.
